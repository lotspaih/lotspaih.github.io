Just pondering the idea of writing posts about agile project and managment concepts related to the field of K-12 [educational technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology) (ed-tech) operations to help increase operational value, improve work flow, and reduce waste.

Core concepts include:

* **Systems Thinking** (How does this affect the entire organization? How does this benefit us beyond right now?)
* **Customer Focus** (Who are our actual “customers”? Students, Staff, Administration?)
* **Continuous Improvement** (How can we improve our processes?)
* **Visualizing Work** (How do we measure, limit, collaborate, make transparent, and increase the accountability of our work?)
* **Create Value / Reduce Waste** (Are we using public tax dollars or private contributions wisely and in good faith? Are the solutions we implement positively impacting our actual “customers”?)
* **Leadership** (Are we leading by example? Are we working together with our entire organization to learn and improve? Are we communicating and collaborating as a team?)
